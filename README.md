When I first began my journey into software development, I was overwhelmed
by the complexity of software development and the level of fragmentation 
amongst common jobs in the market. 

Because of this, I spent hundreds of hours mastering computer science, computer
networking, linux, windows, 4 seperate programming languages, 3 major cloud 
platform vendors, and MANY command line interface tools before finally deciding
the route I wanted to take with my career. 

This document is meant to highlight some of the advice and general information
 I would give to myself if I could go back in time..

 Keep in mind, that I place a high emphasis on where the market is moving and de-emphasize
 skills/jobs that are prevelant today, but, in my opinion, are being actively 
 replaced by skills/technologies that have come out in the last few years.

# Choosing a Career Path

**Please navigate to the statement that most descibes your current interests**


## I am interested in designing user-interfaces
**Difficulty: 3/5**
**Timeline: 6 months**

* You're creative
* You want to create projects that users directly interact with
* You like websites and applications that are easy and intuitive

<details><summary>show</summary>
<p>

**Overview**

The positions you'd be interested involve designing and programming what we call the
"frontend" of applications. The front-end is what users see, and directly interact 
with. 
The frontend of an application, whether is a website, desktop app, or mobile app,
communicates with the "backend" which executes the "business logic" of the application.

The front-end should be designed to be visually appealing, and intuitive for it's users.

In my opinion, the goal of a frontend developer should be to create a user interface that
can be used without any training. The design makes the business logic of the application
self-explanatory. 

For example: Instagram doesn't require users to read through documentation to begin using
it. It is popular because anyone can download the application and immediately start using
it.

**Job Titles**
 * UI Designer
 * UX designer
 * Front-end Developer
 * Front-end Designer

**Average Salary: $85,000**

**Programming Languages**
* HTML 
* CSS
* Javascript

**Tips**

There are many "flavors" of javascript. I'd highly recommend learning the framework "React" after
learning the basics of javascript, HTML, and CSS since it is the most popular, it's in high demand, and you can use it to program the front-end of websites AND mobile apps.
