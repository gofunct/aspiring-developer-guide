When I first began my journey into software development, I was overwhelmed
by the complexity of software development and the level of fragmentation 
amongst common jobs in the market. 

Because of this, I spent hundreds of hours mastering computer science, computer
networking, linux, windows, 4 seperate programming languages, 3 major cloud 
platform vendors, and MANY command line interface tools before finally deciding
the route I wanted to take with my career. 

This document is meant to highlight some of the advice and general information
 I would give to myself if I could go back in time..

 Keep in mind, that I place a high emphasis on where the market is moving and de-emphasize
 skills/jobs that are prevelant today, but, in my opinion, are being actively 
 replaced by skills/technologies that have come out in the last few years.
